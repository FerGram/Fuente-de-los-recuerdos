# Fuente-de-los-recuerdos

La fuente de los recuerdos is a 3-month Unity project developed for the Planet Debug initiative of Jaume I University. 
It has been developed by a 5 member team (all of them members of the repository).

While driving in the dead of the night, Patrick accidentally slips outside the road and crashes his car against a tree.
He is able to come out undamaged but he now needs to fix his car. Patrick notices a sign pointing towards a forest with
what seems to be the name of some place, now barely readable due to poor aging. After traversing the forest, Patrick will
be able to spot a village in the distance, now long forgotten and inhabited. Only the souls of the former habitants remain
there, who our main character will help to bring the village back to life and get his desired car repair.
